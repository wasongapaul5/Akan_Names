                <p id="description">The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the
                  order in which they were born.<br>
                  These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.<br>
                  Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an
                  ancestor's middle name</p>
